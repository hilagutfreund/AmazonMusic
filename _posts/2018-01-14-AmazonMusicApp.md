A semester long graduate project for Engineering Psychology class (Psych 273) at San Jose State University. The objective was to conduct a heuristic evaluation on the Amazon Music app, noting design principle violations and proposing UX design recommendations for these violations.

## Methods
Two main inquiry methods were used to understand how users use the application: user reviews and informal usability exercise.

### User Reviews
Reviews for the Amazon Music app were examined from different application stores, such as the App Store for iOS and the Google Play Store for Android devices, in addition to the Amazon Music Facebook page. 
Some reviews include: 
* _"Every bit is very convoluted and confusing"_
* _"It has become difficult and unduly burdensome to use this app."_
* _"Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expected way more from Amazon."_

### Informal Usability Exercise

An informal usability exercise was conducted with seven participants in order to understand how first-time users interact with the application. The exercise was approximately five minutes long and invovled three tasks. 

## Evaluation

Usability issues were presented on two levels: 
1. Global Usability Problems: High-level design and usability principle violations
2. Local Usability Problems: Usability issues on each screen of the application
